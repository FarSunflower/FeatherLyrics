    `I see you
  You see me
  How pleasant
  This feeling
  The moment
  You hold me
  I missed you
  I'm sorry
  I've given
  What I have
  I showed you
  I'm growing
  The ashes
  Fall slowly
  As your voice
  Consoles me
  As the hours pass
  I will let you know
  That I need to ask
  Before I'm alone
  How it feels to rest
  On your patient lips
  To eternal bliss
  I'm so glad to know
  As the hours pass
  I will let you know
  That I need to ask
  Before I'm alone
  How it feels to rest
  On your patient lips
  To eternal bliss
  I'm so glad to know
  We're swaying
  To drum beats
  In motion
  I'm feeling
  My patience
  Controlling
  The question
  I won't speak
  We're telling
  The stories
  Our laughter
  He knows me
  We're leaving
  We're talking
  You're closer
  It's calming
  As the hours pass
  I will let you know
  That I need to ask
  Before I'm alone
  How it feels to rest
  On your patient lips
  To eternal bliss
  I'm so glad to know
  As the hours pass
  I will let you know
  That I need to ask
  Before I'm alone
  How it feels to rest
  On your patient lips
  To eternal bliss
  I'm so glad to know
  The night will hold us close
  And the stars will guide us home
  I've been waiting for this moment
  We're finally alone
  I turn to ask the question
  So anxious, my thoughts
  Your lips were soft like winter
  In your passion, I was lost
  As the hours pass
  I will let you know
  That I need to ask
  Before I'm alone
  How it feels to rest
  On your patient lips
  To eternal bliss
  I'm so glad to know
  As the hours pass
  I will let you know
  That I need to ask
  Before I'm alone
  How it feels to rest
  On your patient lips
  To eternal bliss
  I'm so glad to know
  As the hours pass
  I will let you know
  That I need to ask
  Before I'm alone
  How it feels to rest
  On your patient lips
  To eternal bliss
  I'm so glad to know
  As the hours pass
  I will let you know
  That I need to ask
  Before I'm alone
  How it feels to rest
  On your patient lips
  To eternal bliss
  I'm so glad to know`,

    `Tell me you need me
  Hold my hand, everything will be okay
  I heard from the heavens that clouds have been grey
  Pull me close, wrap me in your aching arms
  I see that you're hurtin', why'd you take so long
  To tell me you need me? I see that you're bleeding
  You don't need to show me again
  But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
  I won't let go 'til the end
  So cry tonight
  But don't you let go of my hand
  You can cry every last tear
  I won't leave 'til I understand
  Promise me, just hold my hand
  Raise your head, look into my wishful eyes
  That fear that's inside you will lift, give it time
  I can see everything you're blind to now
  Your prayers will be answered, let God whisper how
  To tell me you need me, I see that you're bleeding
  You don't need to show me again
  But if you decide to, I'll ride in this life with you
  I won't let go 'til the end
  So cry tonight
  But don't you let go of my hand
  You can cry every last tear
  I won't leave 'til I understand
  Promise you'll just hold my hand
  Hold my hand, hold my
  Hold my hand, my hand
  I'll be right here, hold my hand
  Hold my hand, hold my
  Hold my hand, my hand
  I'll be right here, hold my hand
  I know you're scared and your pain is imperfect
  But don't you give up on yourself
  I've heard a story, a girl, she once told me
  That I would be happy again
  Hold my hand
  Hold my hand
  Hold my hand, hold my hand
  Hold my hand, hold my hand
  Hold my hand
  I heard from the heavens`,
